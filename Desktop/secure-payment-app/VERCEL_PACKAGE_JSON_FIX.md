# Vercel Package.json Not Found - Complete Fix

## The Problem
Vercel can't find your package.json file, showing error: `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/vercel/path0/package.json'`

## Root Causes & Solutions

### Solution 1: Check GitHub Repository Structure
1. Go to your GitHub repository in a browser
2. Verify that `package.json` is in the **root** of the repository (not in a subfolder)
3. If files are in a subdirectory (like `app/` or `frontend/`), you need to either:
   - Move files to root, OR
   - Set Root Directory in Vercel to that subdirectory name (e.g., `app`)

### Solution 2: Verify Vercel Project Settings
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click **Settings** → **General**
3. Verify these settings:
   - **Root Directory**: Leave BLANK (if files are in repo root)
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Solution 3: Check Connected Branch
1. In Vercel Settings → **Git**
2. Verify the **Production Branch** matches your main branch name
3. Common branch names: `main`, `master`
4. If wrong, change it to the correct branch

### Solution 4: Force Fresh Import
If nothing works, reimport the project:
1. In Vercel, go to project Settings
2. Scroll to **Danger Zone**
3. Click **Delete Project** (don't worry, your code is safe in GitHub)
4. Go to Vercel dashboard
5. Click **Add New** → **Project**
6. Import your repository again
7. Leave Root Directory **BLANK**
8. Deploy

### Solution 5: Verify Git Push
Make sure your latest code is pushed to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix vercel config"
git push origin main
```

Then in Vercel, trigger a new deployment.

## Quick Checklist
- [ ] package.json exists in GitHub repo root
- [ ] Root Directory in Vercel is BLANK
- [ ] Connected to correct branch (main/master)
- [ ] Latest code is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Redeployed after making changes

## Still Not Working?
Check the Vercel deployment logs to see the exact path it's looking for, then verify your GitHub repo structure matches that path.
