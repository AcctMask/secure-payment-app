# ðŸ“‚ NAVIGATE TO YOUR PROJECT DIRECTORY

## You Need to Be in the Right Folder!

Before running git commands, you MUST be in your project directory.

## âœ… Step-by-Step Navigation

### Step 1: Find Your Project
Your project is likely in one of these locations:
- `~/Documents/your-project-name`
- `~/Desktop/your-project-name`
- `~/Projects/your-project-name`

### Step 2: Navigate There
```bash
# Example - adjust to your actual path:
cd ~/Documents/your-project-name

# Or if on Desktop:
cd ~/Desktop/your-project-name

# Or if in Projects folder:
cd ~/Projects/your-project-name
```

### Step 3: Verify You're in the Right Place
```bash
# List files - you should see package.json, src/, etc.
ls -la

# You should see:
# - package.json
# - src/
# - node_modules/
# - vite.config.ts
# - etc.
```

### Step 4: Now Run Git Commands
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "deploy v3.0 - remove diagnostics"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

---

## ðŸš¨ Don't Know Where Your Project Is?

### Find It:
```bash
# Search for your project (replace 'project-name' with actual name)
find ~ -name "package.json" -type f 2>/dev/null | grep your-project-name

# Or search in common locations:
ls ~/Documents/
ls ~/Desktop/
ls ~/Projects/
```

### Once Found:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

---

## âœ… Quick Test
Run this to confirm you're in the right place:
```bash
cat package.json | grep name
```

Should show your project name!
