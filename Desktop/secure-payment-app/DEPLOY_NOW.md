# ðŸš€ DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION - STEP BY STEP

## Step 1: Prepare Your Code
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd secure-purchase

# Check git status
git status
```

## Step 2: Commit All Changes
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Production ready - clean deployment"
```

## Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

**If you get an error about no remote:**
```bash
# Check if remote exists
git remote -v

# If no remote, add it (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/secure-purchase.git

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

### Option A: Automatic (Recommended)
- Vercel will auto-deploy when you push to GitHub

- Check your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard

### Option B: Manual Deploy
```bash
# Make sure you're logged in
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

When prompted:
1. Select your project scope
2. Confirm deployment
3. Wait for build to complete

## Step 5: Verify Deployment
1. Visit your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Visit" to see your live site
