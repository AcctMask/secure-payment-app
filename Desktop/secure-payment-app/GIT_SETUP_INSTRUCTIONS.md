# Fix GitHub Repository - Push Code Only

## Problem
Your code folder doesn't have a .git folder, so git commands aren't working from there. Your GitHub repo has business documents but no application code.

## Solution: Initialize Git in Code Folder

### Step 1: Navigate to Your Code Folder
```bash
cd /path/to/your/code/folder
# (The folder that contains package.json, src/, etc.)
```

### Step 2: Verify You're in the Right Place
```bash
ls -la
# You should see: package.json, src/, node_modules/, etc.
```

### Step 3: Initialize Git Here
```bash
git init
```

### Step 4: Add the Remote Repository
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/AcctMask/secure-payment-app.git
```

### Step 5: Stage Only Application Files
The .gitignore file I created will exclude your business PDFs and documents.

```bash
git add .
git status
# Review what will be committed - should be code files only, no PDFs
```

### Step 6: Commit Your Code
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add secure payment application code"
```

### Step 7: Force Push (Replaces Current Repo Content)
```bash
git push -f origin main
```

## Verify
After pushing, visit: https://github.com/AcctMask/secure-payment-app

You should see:
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ src/ folder
- ✅ All your application code
- ❌ No business PDFs or personal documents

## Alternative: Create Separate Repo
If you want to keep business documents in the current repo:

1. Create a NEW repo: https://github.com/new
2. Name it: `secure-payment-app-code`
3. Use that URL in Step 4 instead
4. Keep your current repo for business documents
