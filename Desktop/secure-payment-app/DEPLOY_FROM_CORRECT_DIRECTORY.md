# Deploy From Correct Directory - Step by Step

## Step 1: Find Your Project Folder

Run this command to search for your project:
```bash
find ~ -name "secure-payment-app" -type d 2>/dev/null
```

This will show you the full path to your project folder.

## Step 2: Navigate to the Project

Once you see the path (example: `/Users/yourname/Documents/secure-payment-app`), navigate to it:
```bash
cd /path/shown/from/step1/secure-payment-app
```

**OR** if you remember where you created it:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/secure-payment-app
# or
cd ~/Documents/secure-payment-app
# or
cd ~/Downloads/secure-payment-app
```

## Step 3: Verify You're in the Right Place

Check that you see package.json and other project files:
```bash
ls -la
```

You should see files like: `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `src/`, etc.

## Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
vercel
```

- **"Set up and deploy?"** ‚Üí Yes

- **"Link to existing project?"** ‚Üí Yes
- **"What's the name?"** ‚Üí secure-payment-app
- **"Override settings?"** ‚Üí No

## Step 5: Deploy to Production
