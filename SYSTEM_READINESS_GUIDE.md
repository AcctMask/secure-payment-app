# System Readiness Guide

## ✅ Diagnostic Panel

A comprehensive diagnostic panel has been added to your application to verify all system components are properly configured.

### Location
The diagnostic panel is located on the main page, below the Supabase connection test.

### What It Checks

#### 1. **Environment Variables**
- ✓ Stripe Publishable Key (shows if TEST or LIVE mode)
- ✓ Premium Price ID
- ✓ Pro Price ID
- ✓ Supabase URL

#### 2. **Database Connection**
- ✓ Supabase connection status
- ✓ All required tables exist:
  - `members` - Member accounts
  - `virtual_cards` - Stripe Issuing cards
  - `transactions` - Purchase history
  - `stripe_webhooks` - Webhook event log

#### 3. **Webhook Status**
- ✓ Webhook table accessible
- ✓ Recent webhook events received
- ✓ Last webhook type and timestamp

## 🎯 How to Use

1. **Open your application** in the browser
2. **Scroll to the Diagnostic Panel** (below the hero section)
3. **Click "Run Diagnostics"**
4. **Review the results**:
   - 🟢 Green = Pass
   - 🔴 Red = Fail (needs attention)
   - 🟡 Yellow = Warning (may need attention)

## 🔧 Interpreting Results

### All Green ✅
Your system is fully configured and ready for:
- Real membership purchases
- Virtual card generation
- Automated card rotation
- Transaction processing

### Red Failures ❌

**Missing Environment Variables:**
- Add the missing variables to your `.env` file
- Restart your development server

**Database Connection Failed:**
- Check your Supabase URL and anon key
- Verify Supabase project is running

**Tables Missing:**
- Run the database migrations in `supabase/migrations/`
- Check Supabase dashboard for table creation

**Webhook Errors:**
- Verify webhook endpoint is configured in Stripe
- Check webhook signing secret

### Yellow Warnings ⚠️

**No Webhooks Received:**
- Normal if you haven't made any purchases yet
- Will turn green after first Stripe event

## 🚀 Ready to Go Live?

All checks should be **GREEN** before:
1. Processing real membership payments
2. Creating virtual cards for members
3. Making purchases with rotating cards

## 📊 What Happens Next

Once all diagnostics pass:

1. **Member Signs Up** → Stripe Checkout → Payment
2. **Webhook Fires** → Member created in database
3. **Virtual Card Created** → Stripe Issuing API
4. **Member Makes Purchase** → Card is used
5. **Webhook Fires** → Card rotates automatically
6. **New Card Ready** → Member can make next purchase

## 🆘 Need Help?

If diagnostics show failures:
1. Check the detailed error messages
2. Review the setup guides in the project root
3. Verify all environment variables are set
4. Ensure Stripe Issuing is enabled for your account
