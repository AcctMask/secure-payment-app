```bash
# Get your member code from the profile modal first
# Replace YOUR_CODE with your actual 12-character code

curl -X POST https://ygongssudngqrseklkah.supabase.co/functions/v1/process-member-payment \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

}
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Membership Purchase Issues:

**Error: "Stripe Price IDs not configured"**
- Check `.env` file has:
  - `VITE_STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID=price_xxxxx`
  - `VITE_STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID=price_xxxxx`
- These must be LIVE price IDs from Stripe Dashboard

**Error: "Stripe key not configured"**
- Check Supabase Edge Function Secrets:
  - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` should start with `sk_live_`

**Webhook not creating member**
- Check webhook endpoint is configured in Stripe
- URL: `https://ygongssudngqrseklkah.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
- Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`
- Check webhook signing secret matches `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

### Member Purchase Issues:

**Error: "Invalid code or membership not found"**
- Verify member exists in `members` table
- Check code matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Code may have been used already (codes rotate after each use)

**Error: "Membership is not active"**
- Check `membership_status` in database is 'active'
- Check subscription hasn't been cancelled

**Error: "Payment failed"**
- Check Stripe customer has valid payment method
- Check payment method hasn't expired
- Check sufficient funds on card
