# FIX VERCEL 404 ERROR - ROOT DIRECTORY ISSUE

## The Problem
Your app is getting 404 errors because Vercel is looking in the wrong directory.

## The Solution - Fix Root Directory Setting

### Step 1: Go to Project Settings
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/secure-purchase/secure-payment-app-6b75
2. Click **"Settings"** tab (top navigation)
3. Click **"General"** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Find Root Directory Setting
Scroll down to the **"Root Directory"** section

### Step 3: Check Current Value
- If it shows **ANY value** (like ".", "./", or any folder name)
- Click **"Edit"** button

### Step 4: Clear It
- **DELETE** any text in the Root Directory field
- Leave it **COMPLETELY BLANK/EMPTY**
- Click **"Save"**

### Step 5: Verify Build Settings
Scroll to **"Build & Development Settings"**:
- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### Step 6: Redeploy
1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click the **top deployment**
3. Click **"Redeploy"** (three dots menu)
4. **Check "Clear Build Cache"**
5. Click **"Redeploy"**

## Why This Fixes It
Vercel needs to build from the repository root where package.json is located. If Root Directory is set to anything else, it can't find your files.

## After Redeploying
Wait 1-2 minutes for the build to complete, then check:
- https://secure-payment-app-6b75.vercel.app

It should now work! âœ“
