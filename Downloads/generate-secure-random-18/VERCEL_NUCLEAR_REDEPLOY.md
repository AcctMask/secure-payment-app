# üî¥ VERCEL NUCLEAR OPTION - Complete Redeploy

## Confirmed Issue
Vercel is serving old cached code. Incognito mode confirms it's NOT browser cache.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE YOU START
- Your GitHub code is CORRECT ‚úÖ
- This will NOT delete your GitHub repository
- Your code is safe - we're only deleting the Vercel deployment
