# Fix Git Conflict - Pull Then Push

## Your Situation
- Local code: âœ… Already committed (nothing to commit)
- GitHub: Has newer changes you don't have locally
- Solution: Pull first, then push

## Run These Commands:

### Step 1: Pull Remote Changes
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
```

**What this does:** Downloads GitHub changes and applies your local commits on top

### Step 2: Push Your Changes
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Trigger Vercel Deploy
- Go to vercel.com
- Find your project
- Click "Deployments" tab
- Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
- **OR** wait 2-3 minutes for auto-deploy

### Step 4: Clear Cache & Check
- Open your site in **Incognito/Private browsing**
- You should see the membership button (no diagnostics)

---

## If Step 1 Shows Conflicts:
```bash
git status
# See which files have conflicts
# Edit those files to fix conflicts
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push origin main
```

## Nuclear Option (if nothing works):
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
# This makes your local exactly match GitHub
```

**Your code is correct - just need to sync!**
