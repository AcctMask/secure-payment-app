# 🔄 Restart Your Development Server

## The Issue
Your local development server (`npm run dev`) was running with old environment variables. The test mode message appears because Vite loads environment variables when the server **starts**, not while it's running.

## ✅ Solution: Restart the Server

### Step 1: Stop the Current Server
In your terminal where the server is running:
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server

### Step 2: Start Fresh
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Verify Live Mode
1. Open http://localhost:5173/ in your browser
2. Click "Join Premium" or "Join Professional"
3. You should now see **LIVE MODE** (no test card instructions)
4. The form will accept real credit cards only

---

## 🔍 What Changed?

I created a `.env` file in your project root with your live Stripe keys:
```
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51S8o3LCYgC6lPmKT...
```

**Before:** Server was reading from old environment (or no .env file)
**After:** Server will read the new .env file with live keys

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Environment Files vs Vercel
- **Local Development** (`npm run dev`): Reads from `.env` file
- **Vercel Deployment**: Reads from Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables

### Security
- The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` (won't be committed to GitHub)
- Your live keys are safe locally
- Never share your `.env` file

### Verification Checklist
After restarting, verify:
- [ ] No test card instructions visible
- [ ] Form accepts real card numbers
- [ ] Console shows: "✅ Stripe configured with valid key: pk_live_..."

## 🚨 If Still Showing Test Mode

### Check Browser Console
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Look for Stripe configuration message
3. Should say: `✅ Stripe configured with valid key: pk_live_...`

### Clear Browser Cache
Sometimes browsers cache the old JavaScript:
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)

### Verify .env File
```bash
cat .env
```
Should show `pk_live_` key, not `pk_test_`

## 📞 Next Steps After Restart

1. **Test with Small Amount**: Use a real card with $0.50 or $1.00 test
2. **Check Stripe Dashboard**: Verify payment appears in live mode
3. **Test Refund**: Process a refund to confirm full workflow

Your payment system is now ready for live transactions! 🎉
