# 🚀 Quick Start - You're Almost There!

## ❌ The Problem
You're in the wrong directory! The error shows you're in:
```
/Users/stephenpashoian/Documents/Secure Purchase/
```

But the project files aren't there.

## ✅ The Solution

### Step 1: Find Your Project
Run this command to find where your project actually is:
```bash
cd ~
find . -name "package.json" -path "*/vite_react_shadcn_ts/*" 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Correct Directory
Once you find it, navigate there. It's likely in one of these locations:
```bash
# Option A: If you're working in this AI environment
cd /path/to/project

# Option B: If you cloned from GitHub
cd ~/vite_react_shadcn_ts

# Option C: If it's in a different location
cd /Users/stephenpashoian/path/to/actual/project
```

### Step 3: Verify You're in the Right Place
```bash
ls -la
```
You should see: `package.json`, `src/`, `public/`, `index.html`, etc.

### Step 4: Now Run the Install
```bash
npm install
```

## 🎯 Quick Commands Once You're in the Right Directory

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 💡 Pro Tip
The directory name "Secure Purchase" has a space in it, which can cause issues. Consider renaming:
```bash
cd /Users/stephenpashoian/Documents/
mv "Secure Purchase" secure-purchase
cd secure-purchase
```

## 🆘 Still Stuck?
If you can't find the project files, you may need to:
1. Clone/download the project first
2. Or create a new directory and copy the files there
3. Contact support for help locating your project files
