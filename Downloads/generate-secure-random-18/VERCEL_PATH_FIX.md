# Fix Vercel /vercel/path0/ Error

## Step 1: Check Your GitHub Repository Structure

1. Go to your GitHub repository in a browser
2. Look at the root level files
3. **Do you see `package.json` at the root?**

### Scenario A: package.json IS at root level
```
your-repo/
├── package.json          ← HERE
├── src/
├── public/
├── index.html
└── vite.config.ts
```
**If this is your structure, go to Solution A below**

### Scenario B: package.json is in a subdirectory
```
your-repo/
├── README.md
└── my-project/           ← folder name
    ├── package.json      ← HERE
    ├── src/
    └── index.html
```
**If this is your structure, go to Solution B below**

## Solution A: Files at Root (package.json visible at root)

### In Vercel Settings → General:
- **Root Directory**: Leave EMPTY or set to `.`
- Click Save

### Then check Git settings:
1. Settings → Git
2. Verify the correct branch is selected (usually `main` or `master`)
3. Redeploy

---

## Solution B: Files in Subdirectory

### Find the folder name:
Look at your GitHub repo - what's the folder name containing package.json?
Common names: `frontend`, `app`, `client`, or your project name

### In Vercel Settings → General:
- **Root Directory**: Enter the folder name (e.g., `frontend` or `my-project`)
- Click Save
- Redeploy

---

## Still Not Working?

### Nuclear Option - Reconnect Repository:

1. **Vercel Dashboard** → Your Project → Settings → General
2. Scroll to bottom → **Delete Project** (don't worry, code is safe in GitHub)
3. Go to Vercel Dashboard → **Add New Project**
4. Import your GitHub repo again
5. During import, if it asks for Root Directory, enter the correct path
6. Deploy

---

## Quick Check Command (Run locally):

```bash
# In your terminal, run:
ls -la

# You should see package.json listed
# If not, you're in the wrong directory
```

If you don't see package.json, run `cd [folder-name]` then `ls -la` again.
