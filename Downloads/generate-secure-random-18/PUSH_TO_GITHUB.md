# Push Changes to GitHub from Famous.ai

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your changes in Famous.ai are NOT automatically pushing to GitHub, which means Vercel isn't deploying them.

## Step 1: Check Git Status in Famous.ai Terminal

In the Famous.ai terminal/console, run:
```bash
git status
```

**If you see:** `fatal: not a git repository`
→ Git is not initialized. Continue to Step 2.

**If you see:** Files listed as modified/untracked
→ Git is initialized. Skip to Step 3.

## Step 2: Initialize Git (if needed)

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/AcctMask/secure-payment-app.git
git branch -M main
```

## Step 3: Stage and Commit Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update from Famous.ai - $(date)"
```

## Step 4: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

**If you get "rejected" error:**
```bash
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

1. Check GitHub: https://github.com/AcctMask/secure-payment-app/commits
2. Check Vercel Dashboard: Should show new deployment
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
4. Visit: https://securepurchase.co (clear cache or use incognito)

## Automate Future Pushes

Create this script in Famous.ai:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
git add .
git commit -m "Auto-update $(date)"
git push origin main
echo "✅ Pushed to GitHub - Vercel will deploy in ~2 minutes"
```

Save as `push.sh` and run: `bash push.sh` whenever you want to deploy.

## Troubleshooting

**"Permission denied"**: Set up SSH key or use Personal Access Token
**"Nothing to commit"**: No changes detected
**"Divergent branches"**: Run `git pull --rebase` first
