# ✅ DEPLOYMENT CONFLICT FIXED

## What Was Done
I've deleted the conflicting GitHub Actions workflow files that were competing with Vercel's native deployment.

## Files Removed:
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/preview-deploy.yml`

## Next Steps - Push to GitHub:

### Step 1: Open Terminal
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", press Enter
- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type "cmd", press Enter

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/secure-purchase
```
*(Adjust the path if your project is elsewhere)*

### Step 3: Verify You're in the Right Place
```bash
pwd
```
Should show your project path

### Step 4: Check Git Status
```bash
git status
```
Should show deleted workflow files

### Step 5: Stage the Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 6: Commit the Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Remove conflicting GitHub Actions workflows"
```

### Step 7: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push
```

### Step 8: Verify in Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for auto-deploy
4. Check if deployment succeeds

## How It Works Now:
✅ You push code to GitHub
✅ Vercel automatically detects the push
✅ Vercel builds and deploys (no conflicts!)

## Troubleshooting:
If push fails with authentication error:
```bash
git push origin main
```

If still issues, you may need to re-authenticate with GitHub.
