# ðŸš€ FORCE GITHUB â†’ VERCEL SYNC - October 21, 2025 @ 4:52 PM

## THE PROBLEM
Vercel is showing OLD code (SystemDiagnostics screen) even though GitHub has the NEW code.

## WHAT WAS CHANGED
1. âœ… **main.tsx** - Added timestamp comment to force rebuild
2. âœ… **index.html** - Added cache-busting meta tags
3. âœ… **AppLayout.tsx** - Already clean (no SystemDiagnostics)

## PUSH TO GITHUB NOW

```bash
cd secure-payment-app
git add .
git commit -m "FORCE REBUILD: Remove SystemDiagnostics cache - Oct 21 4:52pm"
git push origin main
```

## THEN FORCE VERCEL REDEPLOY

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click your project "secure-payment-app"
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "..." on latest deployment
5. Click "Redeploy"
6. **CRITICAL:** UNCHECK "Use existing Build Cache" âœ…
7. Click "Redeploy" button

### Option 2: Delete Vercel Project & Reconnect
If Option 1 doesn't work:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project Settings
2. Scroll to bottom â†’ "Delete Project"
3. Confirm deletion
4. Click "New Project" â†’ Import from GitHub
5. Select "secure-payment-app" repo
6. Deploy fresh

## VERIFY IT WORKED
After deployment completes:
1. Open your Vercel URL
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to hard refresh
3. You should see: "Secure Purchase Code Generator" hero section
4. You should NOT see: "System Readiness Check" screen

## IF STILL SHOWING OLD VERSION
Try these in order:
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Try incognito/private window
3. Try different browser
4. Check Vercel build logs for errors
5. Verify GitHub shows latest commit timestamp

## TIMESTAMP
