# Fix: System Readiness Page Still Showing

## ‚úÖ WHAT I FIXED
I've removed all "System Readiness Check" sections from the main app layout. The code is now clean.

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS TO DEPLOY

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
cd secure-payment-app
git add .
git commit -m "Remove system readiness page - clean deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Trigger Vercel Redeploy
Go to your Vercel dashboard:
1. Open https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "secure-payment-app" project
3. Click on it
4. Go to "Deployments" tab
5. Click the three dots (...) on the latest deployment
6. Click "Redeploy"
7. Wait for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache
After deployment completes:
1. Open your site: https://secure-payment-app.vercel.app
2. **Hard refresh** your browser:
   - **Windows/Linux**: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - **Mac**: Cmd + Shift + R
   - **Safari**: Cmd + Option + R

## ‚úÖ WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE
- **Hero heading**: "Secure Purchase Code Generator"
- **Main CTA**: "Get Real Membership Now" button
- **Modern gradient background** (dark blue/purple)
- **NO "System Readiness Check" button** in the hero section

## ‚ùå WHAT YOU SHOULD NOT SEE
- "System Readiness Check" as main page
- Old diagnostic screens
- Test mode warnings

## üîç IF STILL SHOWING OLD VERSION
The issue is likely caching. Try:
1. Open in **Incognito/Private browsing** mode
2. Try a different browser
3. Check Vercel deployment logs to confirm latest commit was deployed
4. Wait 5 minutes for CDN cache to clear
