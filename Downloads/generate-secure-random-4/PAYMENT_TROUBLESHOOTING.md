# Payment Form Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Card Details Fields Not Accepting Input

### Problem Description
The payment form shows card input fields but they don't accept any input when clicking "Join Premium".

### Solution

The application now includes a fallback payment form that works without Stripe configuration. The form accepts the following test card details:

**Test Card Information:**
- **Card Number:** 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Expiry Date:** Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
- **CVC:** Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
- **Email:** Any valid email format
- **Name:** Any name

### How It Works

1. **Without Stripe Configuration:**
   - The app uses `SimplePaymentForm` component
   - Manual input fields for all card details
   - Simulated payment processing for testing

2. **With Stripe Configuration:**
   - The app uses Stripe Elements
   - Secure card input via Stripe's CardElement
   - Real payment processing through Stripe API

### Setting Up Stripe (Optional)

To enable real Stripe payments:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your Stripe publishable key:
   ```
   VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_key_here
   ```
3. Restart the development server

### Testing the Payment Form

1. Click "Join Premium" in the navigation
2. Select a membership plan
3. Enter the test card details shown above
4. Click "Subscribe"

The form will validate all fields and show appropriate error messages if any field is missing or invalid.
