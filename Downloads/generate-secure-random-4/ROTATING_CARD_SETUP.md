# Rotating Virtual Card System - Setup Complete

## Overview
Your app now has a **rotating virtual card system** that automatically generates a new Stripe Issuing virtual card after every purchase for maximum security.

## How It Works

### 1. Member Subscribes
- Member pays for subscription via Stripe Checkout
- Webhook receives `checkout.session.completed` event
- System automatically creates:
  - Stripe Issuing Cardholder
  - First virtual card (16-digit number, CVV, expiry)
  - Member record in database

### 2. Member Uses Card
- Member clicks "View Card Details" button
- Modal displays real card number, CVV, and expiry date
- Member copies card details to use on Amazon, eBay, or any website
- Card can also be added to Apple Pay/Google Pay for tap-to-pay

### 3. Automatic Card Rotation
- When member makes a purchase, Stripe fires webhook event:
  - `issuing_authorization.created` (when card is authorized)
  - `issuing_transaction.created` (when transaction completes)
- Webhook automatically:
  1. Cancels the old virtual card
  2. Creates a brand new virtual card
  3. Updates database with new card ID
- Member refreshes modal to see new card details

## Key Features

✅ **Real Stripe Issuing Cards** - Not fake codes, actual working cards
✅ **Automatic Rotation** - New card after every purchase
✅ **Works Everywhere** - Amazon, eBay, any online store
✅ **Apple/Google Pay** - Add to mobile wallet for tap-to-pay

## User Flow

1. **Subscribe** → Get first virtual card automatically
2. **View Card** → Click "View Card Details" button
3. **Copy Details** → Card number, CVV, expiry
4. **Shop Online** → Use on Amazon or any website
5. **Auto-Rotate** → New card generated after purchase
6. **Refresh** → View new card details in modal

## Technical Implementation

### Webhook Events Handled
```
checkout.session.completed → Create first card
issuing_authorization.created → Rotate card
issuing_transaction.created → Rotate card
customer.subscription.deleted → Cancel card
```

### Database Fields
```
members table:
- stripe_cardholder_id (Stripe Issuing Cardholder)
- stripe_card_id (Current active card)
- card_status (active/cancelled)
```

### Components
